% INSTRUCTIONS FOR WRITING YOUR GENERATIVE AI DECLARATION
%----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

\subsection*{Purpose of This Declaration}

This section requires a declaration about your use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Grammarly, Copilot) during thesis preparation. Transparency about AI usage is increasingly required by academic institutions and publishers to maintain research integrity and scholarly standards.

Your declaration should clearly state:

\begin{itemize}
\item Which AI tools you used and for what specific purposes (editing, proofreading, translation, literature search, brainstorming, etc.)
\item A clear statement that you reviewed and validated all AI-generated content
\item Confirmation that AI was not used for original research, data analysis, or core scientific work (unless explicitly part of your methodology)
\item A statement of your full responsibility for the final content and intellectual contributions
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Where to Get Guidance}

Before writing your declaration, consult the following resources:

\begin{itemize}
\item Check your institution's specific AI usage policies and requirements
\item Consult your supervisor or thesis committee for their expectations
\item Review your field's journal guidelines (e.g., Nature, Science editorial policies on AI)
\item UZH resources: visit \texttt{https://www.uzh.ch/} and search for AI in academic integrity policies
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Example Statement}

The following is an example declaration statement that you should adapt to reflect your actual AI usage. Delete or modify sections that do not apply to your work, and ensure all statements accurately represent how you used AI tools in your thesis preparation.

\noindent In the preparation of this doctoral thesis, generative artificial intelligence (AI) tools were selectively employed for language refinement and copy editing. Specifically, Grammarly, Perplexity, and Microsoft Copilot assisted in enhancing grammatical accuracy, improving readability, and ensuring clarity of expression. As a non-native English speaker, these tools helped optimize technical communication while preserving academic voice.

\noindent All AI-generated content underwent rigorous critical evaluation and manual editing to ensure alignment with research integrity standards. The systems were never used to generate original scientific content, analyze data, or formulate research conclusions. The author remains fully responsible for the work's intellectual content, interpretations, and academic rigor.

\noindent This application of AI technologies adhered to institutional ethical guidelines and data privacy protocols. No sensitive or proprietary information was disclosed during AI interactions, with privacy settings activated where available. The tools served exclusively as editorial aids, maintaining human oversight throughout the writing process.

\noindent This declaration is made following current best practices for transparency in academic research and reflects my commitment to the responsible and ethical use of generative AI technologies.

\subsection*{Optional Addendum}

If you used AI tools for purposes beyond copy editing, you may include an additional statement such as:

\textit{During the research process, AI tools were additionally leveraged for [briefly mention other uses, e.g., initial literature discovery or brainstorming], with all outputs rigorously fact-checked and contextualized within the thesis.}

\subsection*{Final Note}

Remember to delete these instructional sections before submitting your thesis. Your final declaration should contain only your personal statement about AI usage, properly adapted to your specific circumstances.
